            "This unit is a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment located in a mid-20th-century multi-story building. The layout is efficient and functional, with a moderately sized living room, a separate bedroom, a small but windowed kitchen, and a compact bathroom. Circulation is through short hallways and archways, with good natural light throughout. The building has secured entries and windows, and the heating is via radiators. There are no signs of in-unit laundry or additional floors within the unit itself.\n",
